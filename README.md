# Discord Unicode Emojis

This is a [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) plugin that automatically escapes emojis that you type in chat, turning them into their unicode equivalents.

### With plugin:

## Performance

If you, for some reason, paste in a lot of emojis at once, the plugin will slowly escape them one by one. This is to prevent discord from freezing, although it will still lag pretty bad. Even without this plugin, discord really struggles when presented with a lot of emojis at once.
